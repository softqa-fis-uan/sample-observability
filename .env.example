# Example environment variables for local development
# Copy this file to `.env` and fill in real values. Do NOT commit a populated `.env`.

# Sentry DSNs
SENTRY_DSN_FRONTEND=
SENTRY_DSN_BACKEND=

# Optional: Sentry auth token used by the Sentry webpack plugin (if you use it locally)
# SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=

# Notes:
# - When running locally, you can `cp .env.example .env` and then edit `.env` before
#   running `docker compose up -d` or `npm start` in the frontend directory.
# - In CI (GitHub Actions) provide values as repository secrets (SENTRY_DSN_FRONTEND,
#   SENTRY_DSN_BACKEND) — the workflow already maps them into the job environment.
